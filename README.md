# Boston-Price-Regularized-Reg
Solving machine learning problem to predict house price

This machine learning project uses the "Boston Housing" dataset derived from information collected by the U.S. Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston MA. The objective here is we need to create a model that can predict the house price using regularized regression.

## How to use it?
You just can simply download code from this repository and open your Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab then open the .ipynb data in the notebook.
